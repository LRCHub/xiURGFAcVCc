Lover won't you wake up
I need you now
Lover won't you wake up
We gotta get out
Lover won't you wake up
I need you now
Lover won't you wake up
We gotta get out
Lover won't you wake up
I need you now
Lover...

I can see dealers
Material men
I can see dreamers
They chew 'pon dem pens
But you're rough, so rough
Waiting for a judgment
But you're rough, so rough
Saying prayers 'pon dem gunmen

Call your protectors
So jealous, so proud
There's a column of the darkest men
On the road to your house
This is my town
This is my home
This is my throne
This is my home
This is my town
This is my home
This is my throne
This is my home
