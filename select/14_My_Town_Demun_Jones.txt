Big guns
Loud pipes
Get wild
Lets fight
Truck beds
Ice down
Jones county
My town

Country girls
My type
Dixie dimes
Just right
Crank it up
Get loud
Throw it down
All night

Demun jones
From the muddy south
Highway 11
With the Creek behind the house
Anywhere you turn guns bust around the house
Hard work, hard play

Yeah, thats what we about

I love them country girls
We call them dixie dimes

And then she gets loud with 'er hands in the air
With the music turnt up like she just don't care

Hundred red necks
99 of em
From the heart of georgia

Big guns
Loud pipes
Get wild
Lets fight
Truck beds
Ice down
Jones County
My town

Country girls
My type
Dixie dimes
Just right
Crank it up
Get loud
Throw it down
All night

Got a ride big enough to hide guns inside
Ain't got a refrigerator cause all the food is alive
Got a ride big enough to haul around the fellows
Got a wardrobe that'll make uncle si jealous
Can't call it a duck quite as good as Willie
But i gotta right hook
That'll knock your ass silly

Hillbilly maniac
Ive been to jail one time
And i ain't goin back

Big guns
Loud pipes
Get wild
Lets fight
Truck beds
Ice down
Jones County
My town

County girls
My type
Dixie dimes
Just right
Crank it up
Get loud
Throw it down
All night

All the girls
Get done up

Crank it up
Get line
Throw it down

All the girls
Get done up

Big guns
Loud pipes
Get wild
Lets fight
Trunk beds
Ice down
Jones County
