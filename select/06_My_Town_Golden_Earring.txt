From the Albums:
* Prisoner of the night
* 2nd Live

My town is sittin' on the ocean
My town paradise livin'
My town is all right
I've got fine friends livin' 'round the corner
Crazy friends party every night
My town is all right
I'll give you some time
To make up your mind
Give you some time
To pack a samsonite
Gotta start lookin' for the signs
The signs leadin' to my town
We've got big girls sittin' in the red light
Pretty girls bakin' in the sunlight
Our girls are all right
I got no fear for the cops & the robber
I drink beer with the drunks & the dealer
Our town - my town is all right
Give you some time
To make up your mind
Give you some time
To pack a samsonite
We're gonna set this city on fire
Come alive - get down to my town
My town is floatin' down the river
My town lies dreamin' in the valley
My town is all right
We've got nightclubs - discothecs - theatres
Shoeshine and cheap parking meters
Our town is all right
We're on fire down in my town
